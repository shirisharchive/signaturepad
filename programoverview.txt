Overall plan is to make a signature pad with color changing features.
You can sign in pad once clicking is done.
And wherever the you direct the mouse your signature is done in that way.

All is features are achieved by usig the mouse events: click-> StartDrawing
        mousemove->StartDrawing
        mouseup and mouseout ->stops the drawing.


Today I come to know about the events i.e touchstart,touchmove and touch end whichare events i.e trigerred whenever the user touches the screen.

touchstart->draw in canvas whenever the touch is detected.
touchmove-> events occurs in the direction where the user drives their finger.

touchend-> this detects the finger is still in pad or not.

I got them and their features. I will modify my code to implement these features.

control+Shift+L is used to change the selected item is vs code.
